We are thrilled to announce that our project, PlatePal, has clinched the prestigious Accelerator Award within the Edmonton Cohort 2023.

## Project Overview

PlatePal is a pioneering initiative designed to assist low-income individuals, including students and workers, in acquiring groceries more efficiently, addressing the pressing issue of rising food insecurity. The primary functions of this version include:

1. Webscraping for Real-time Deals: Leveraging Flipp.com, we dynamically update the platform with the latest deals and grocery prices, ensuring users have access to the most cost-effective options.

2. Store Localization: PlatePal identifies nearby stores based on the user's location, streamlining the grocery shopping process.

3. Budget-Based Grocery Recommendations: Users input their budget, and the system generates curated lists of grocery items in four essential categories: Carbs, Dairy, Fresh Produce, and Protein.

4. Optimization with Q-learning: PlatePal employs a Q-learning agent to find the optimal combination of items, maximizing the number of products in each category while staying within the user's budget.

## Acknowledgments
We extend our gratitude to Flipp.com for providing essential data and support for this project.
